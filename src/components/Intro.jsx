        <p>
          This is a collection of my Christian-themed poetry — written from my own walk with Christ — poignant moments of longing, gratitude, struggle, and grace — brought to life against a backdrop of deep reflection and personal spiritual growth that every believer experiences in their own walk with Jesus.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is my hope that as you browse through my collection you would be both refreshed and inspired to draw closer to Him in a deeper, more intimate walk as you experience His enduring love.
